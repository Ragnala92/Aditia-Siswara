About Me
AI content creator and generative filmmaker focused on crafting cinematic visuals using cutting-edge AI tools.

Experienced in combining prompt engineering, cinematography, and color grading to create short films, brand commercials, and emotionally driven storytelling content.

Passionate about blending traditional film language (camera composition, lighting, lensing) with generative models so the results still feel truly “cinema,” not just generic AI output.

Open to collaborations on AI video projects, brand campaigns, and new formats such as vertical series or interactive content.
